Whenever we sign up on a website, we are required to create a password. With the increasing threats to online accounts, it is essential to take extra steps to enhance security. A strong password should include a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.  

To address this, I have developed a password generator webpage that allows users to create secure passwords with customizable character requirements. Additionally, the webpage features a password strength calculator to evaluate the strength of the generated password. Users can also set their preferred password length, ranging from 1 to 20 characters, with the default length set to 10.

ADVANTAGES OF THIS WEBPAGE
<ul>
  <li>Have a Slider Using which you can control the length of your password</li>
  <li>Everytime it is going to generate random password with all the characters checked to be included using checkboxes</li>
  <li>Have a Strength Detector algorithm</li>
  <li>You can directly copy the password to the clipboard in a single click</li>
</ul>
